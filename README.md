## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

•⁠  ⁠Java JDK 8 or later installed  
•⁠  ⁠MySQL Server with a user account and a database named ⁠ employeemanagement ⁠  
•⁠  ⁠MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J)

### 📦 Setup Steps

1.⁠ ⁠*Clone the repository*
⁠ bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankur083/Employee-Management-System.git
 ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠*Open in your preferred Java IDE*  
   IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

3.⁠ ⁠*Import the Driver*  
   Add the ⁠ .jar ⁠ file (e.g., ⁠ mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar ⁠) to your project libraries.  
   Add all the ⁠ .jar ⁠ files from ⁠ External_Library ⁠ that are present inside the Employee Management System folder.

4.⁠ ⁠*Configure the database connection*  
   Open ⁠ Server.java ⁠ and update:
⁠ java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employeemanagement";
String user = "root";
String password = "yourpassword"; // Replace with your MySQL password
 ⁠
Then run the SQL code in MySQL Workbench. The SQL script is located in ⁠ DataBse.sql ⁠ file inside the Employee Management System folder.

5.⁠ ⁠*Start the Server*  
   Run ⁠ Server.java ⁠ to launch the multithreaded server.

6.⁠ ⁠*Run the Client*  
   Run ⁠ Client.java ⁠ to start the GUI-based application on the client side.
